# LFHacks Leapster Dumper
We're proud to present the LFHacks Leapster Dumper shield for the Arduino Mega 2560. This is entirely based off of the code and designs made by JAMMArcade.net and Team Europe. Using the files in the repository, you should be able to purchase these boards preassembled from JLCPCB for around $35-40 USD. Note that this board is untested, and just being put up on a repository to show it exists. This README and repository will be updated once it's tested.

The files for this board are released under the GPL v3 License. The copyright notice for this board is the LFHacks name and the credit to JAMMArcade and TeamEurope on the top side of the board. Removal of these from the board is a violation of the license.
